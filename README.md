# Fraud Detection and Prevention in Financial Transactions

## üìä Overview
This project focuses on improving fraud detection in financial transactions using machine learning models. The primary goal is to identify fraudulent transactions based on historical data and enhance the existing fraud detection system, reducing financial losses and improving customer trust. The models used in this project include **LightGBM**, **Random Forest**, and **XGBoost**, with a focus on performance metrics such as accuracy, sensitivity, and PPV.

## üéØ Objectives
- **Fraud Detection**: Detect fraudulent transactions based on patterns in transaction amount, location, time, and customer behavior.
- **Model Evaluation**: Compare the performance of different machine learning models (LightGBM, Random Forest, XGBoost) to find the most effective for fraud detection.
- **Provide Solutions**: Propose solutions to improve the fraud detection system, particularly for customers aged 65 and above.

## üßë‚Äçüíª Data Sources
- **Synthetic Transaction Records**: 500,000 records of transaction data generated from fraud detection systems, including variables such as transaction amount, type, location, balance, and time.
- **Customer Demographics**: Age, location, transaction history, and customer activity.

## üîß Tools & Techniques
- **Machine Learning Models**: LightGBM, Random Forest, XGBoost.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Accuracy, Sensitivity, Specificity, and Positive Predictive Value (PPV).
- **Confusion Matrix**: Used to analyze True Positives, False Positives, True Negatives, and False Negatives in fraud detection.

## üîç Key Findings
- **Fraud Patterns**: Fraudulent transactions are typically small and occur during periods of low customer activity, especially between **0 - 6 AM**.
- **Model Performance**: 
  - **LightGBM** achieved the highest accuracy (0.784) and AUC (0.871).
  - **Random Forest** and **XGBoost** performed comparably with slightly lower accuracy.
  - **PPV** values were low, indicating the need for further model optimization.

## üí° Recommendations
- **Transaction Alerts**: Implement OTP verification and limit banking services for customers aged 65 and above during high-risk hours (0 - 6 AM).
- **Flagging Strategy**: Rather than blocking transactions immediately, flag suspicious accounts for further investigation to reduce false positives.
- **Regular Updates**: Send fraud pattern updates and summary statements, particularly on Wednesdays, to help customers identify potential fraud.

## üìà Fraudulent Transactions Breakdown
- **57.32%** of fraudulent transactions were **online**.
- **32.92%** were **offline withdrawals**.
- **13.33%** were categorized as **others**.
